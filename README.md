# ble-auth
Home IoT Bluetooth Low-Energy Authentication for PCs

A simple server-client authentication framework for Bluetooth Low-Energy devices.
I use this software on a Raspberry Pi 3 in my room to control locking and unlocking
my computers on WiFi/LAN. This project currently doesn't actually contain much
defensive authentication, but TLS communication and API keys will be added when the
base PoC is perfected.

Currently this project has only a Linux/Gnome client, but will be extended in the future
for both Windows-based operating systems and other Linux managers by the way of scripting.
